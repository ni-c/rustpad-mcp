# Build stage
#
# node:24-alpine is the ACTIVE LTS line, not the newest tag — roughly half of all
# Node majors never become LTS, so "newest" and "supported" are different things.
# Only the major belongs in this note. A patch version written here would be
# falsified by the next digest bump, which would arrive red for a reason nobody
# needs to act on. CI checks the claim instead, on every run
# (.github/scripts/check-base-image-pin.sh): `node:lts-alpine` and
# `node:24-alpine` must resolve to the same digest, and the digest pinned below
# must be a Node 24 image. The day 24 leaves LTS, that fails.

# CVE-2026-14456: the pinned base image carries OpenSSL 3.5.7-r0, and Alpine's
# fixed 3.5.8-r0 has not been rebuilt into node:24-alpine yet. Upgrading these
# two packages by name rather than running a blanket `apk upgrade` keeps the
# rest of the image exactly as the digest pins it. Drop this once the base
# image ships the fix.
